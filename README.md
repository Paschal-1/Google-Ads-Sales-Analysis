##Google-Ads-Sales-Analysis
Power BI dashboard analyzing Google Ads campaign performance and sales ROI.
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Ads campaign data to identify which campaigns and audience segments drove sales. The analysis informed budget reallocation and campaign optimization recommendations.
## Objectives
- Assess relationship between ad spend and sales conversions.
- Identify highest ROI campaigns and best-performing audience segments.
- Recommend budget shifts to maximize revenue.
## Tools \& Tech
- Power BI (dashboard)
- Excel (data cleaning)
- SQL (data extraction \& joins)
- DAX (measures \& KPIs)
## Data
- Source: Internal Google Ads sales export (CSV) + Sales transactions (CSV).
- Time period: Nov 1, 2024 – Nov 31, 2024.
- Note: Data shared here is a sample / anonymized extract to protect confidentiality.
## Methodology
1\. Cleaned and merged ad spend and sales datasets in Excel/SQL.
2\. Created calculated metrics (CPA, ROAS, conversion rate) using DAX.
3\. Built interactive Power BI dashboard to explore campaigns, devices, and regions.
4\. Performed A/B-style comparisons across audience segments.
## Key Insights
- Returning customers converted at \*\*~30% higher\*\* rate than new users.
- Campaign `Branded-Search-Q2` had the best ROAS: \*\*4.2x\*\*.
- Mobile impressions were high but conversion rate was \*\*25% lower\*\* vs desktop.
- Reallocating 10% of spend from low-ROAS campaigns to top campaigns projected to increase revenue by \*\*~15%\*\*.
